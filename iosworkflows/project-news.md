## Project updates

### February 25: Ready to Launch

This project got announced a little bit earlier than I'd planned but it's finally to point where I had intended to launch it at. I've added a few new workflows and fixed or improved many more, everything *should* be tested and working now. 

The documentation is started and while there's more to do I think it should make things a little easier. I'm hopeful that I can find a better solution to the Drafts actions install process as well as for installing Mr. Reader services but that may not be possible with GitHub. I'd welcome any suggestions!

I'm reasonably happy with the template and overall structure of the project, I definitely hope that it will work well as we continue adding more and more workflows.

There's still a lot that I want to learn about GitHub but the project has been forked by two awesome collaborators and I have merged in new changes, hopefully I won't make any more [embarrassing testing mistakes](http://twitter.com/chrisWhite/status/304486452023132160).

What's next?

- Add more apps! There's a bunch in the coming-soon folder and I'm planning on hitting Pinner, Scratch and the brand new awesome [Write](http://writeapp.net/) iPhone text editor next.
- I like what [Michael Xander](https://github.com/michaelx) is doing with the [Bookmarklets page](_bookmarklets.md) and I'm considering doing collective Drafts actions, Mr. Reader services, etc. pages in the same way.
- I'd like to get some more complex Drafts actions created. There are some awesome examples of this kind of thing over on [MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls/).

I'm also going to start digging into [MyScripts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myscripts/id492086539?mt=8), it's similar to [Pythonista](http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/) but for JavaScript. I don't know how quickly I'll be able to turn out anything very useful though.

### February 20, 2013: Huge update

Just pushed a *huge* update. 

Please let me know if you run into any trouble with the changes.

Here are a few highlights:

- New workflows and improvements throughout the project. Check out the [Pinbook](pinbook.md) workflows in particular.
- Restructured all of the Markdown files for easier browsing and navigation.
- Created [template.md](template.md) to help keep things organized and consistent. If you want to pitch in with new workflows or entirely new apps this is the place to start.
- Started a new [Guide](guide.md) with directions for [installing Drafts Actions](guide.md#installing-drafts-actions) and [Mr. Reader Services](guide.md#installing-mr-reader-browser-and-other-app-services) as well as notes on [bookmarklet limitations and workarounds with different browsers](guide.md#bookmarklet-limitations-for-selected-text-in-different-browsers).
- Updated the [README](README.md) with social and contact information as well as contributors.
- Broke off the news section into a different [Project News](project-news.md) file.
- Uploaded Mr. Reader service files for easier installation.

Hopefully I've got things stable now and future updates will be smaller and more iterative.
